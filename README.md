# Medication Reminder App Project
This repository contains the code for my third year project at the university of lincoln.

This project is an android application, used to provide reminders to people to take medication.

# Background
One of the main issues in the medical world is ensuring that people are adherent to a medication regime. With about 50% of people who regularly take medication stating that they sometimes aren't adherent. This can lead to the patient needing more treatment or their symptoms resurfacing. 

## This project is currently in testing. 

This application, although developed is for educational and research purposes. It is not intended to replace what has been prescribed by your doctor. Please take your medication as is expected by those who prescribed it to you.
